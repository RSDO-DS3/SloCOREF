- Existing solutions: details in report
- Initial ideas: details in report

## Interim defense
- Introduction: details in report
- Related work: details in report
- Implemented baseline: [setup](https://github.com/matejklemen/slovene-coreference-resolution#setup)
- Future directions: add trivial models as additional baselines, implement one or more embedding-based approaches: 
    - purely embeddings (contextual|non-contextual, depending on time)
    - embeddings + some handcrafted features  
    The goal is to see if the amount of manual feature engineering can be reduced (because here, handcrafting features 
    requires a lot of linguistic knowledge).
