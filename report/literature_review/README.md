Mention as existing work on this topic in lit. review. | / |
| 12. | Deep Neural Networks for Coreference Resolution for Polish | [link](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1060/) | Does coreference resolution for the Polish language. Mention as existing work on this topic in lit. review. Also possible source for ideas. | / |
| 13. | Ellipsis and Coreference Resolution as Question Answering | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11141) | Poses coreference resolution as a question-answering problem. Interesting idea, mention as existing work on this topic in lit. review. | / |
| 14. | Learning Word Representations with Cross-Sentence Dependency for End-to-End Co-reference Resolution | [link](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1518.pdf) | Improves the standard end-to-end coreference `(3.)` resolution system with information of neighbouring sentences (not just the sentence in which mention is). Mention as existing work on this topic in lit. review. | / |
| 15. | Gendered Pronoun Resolution using BERT and an extractive question answering formulation | [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03695) | / | The QA formulation seems very similar to `(13.)`, needs a closer look. |
| 16. | Exploring Spanish Corpora for Portuguese Coreference Resolution | [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8554705) | Does transfer learning between Spanish and Portuguese for coreference resolution. Mention as existing literature (less resourced languages). | / |
